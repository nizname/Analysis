# Analysis

conceptual approach

1. Analyse the data and seclect appropriate tool to analyse
2. From the data extract total errors received
3. Detailed study of different errors received

Trade-offs

1.Use a best tool to analse 

runtime performance

1. runtime perfomance is average 

complexity

1. most of response is above 200 ms

bottlenecks

1. Login response time is more for some of the requests

If i had more time 

1. I would first get a tool to analyse the log
2. Prioratize which logs to be entered as data
3. Analyze based up on response time
4. Examine by process id
4. Test the script and check for suitable output
